# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my final project for AlbanyCanCode's JavaScript Fundamentals class.
The goal of this project was to create a functional Tic-Tac-Toe web app, using vanilla JavaScript.
This project currently lives at https://www.kristoff.dev/tic-tac-toe/, or can be played by [downloading this repo as a zip file](https://github.com/klalicki/tic-tac-toe/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extracting it, and opening index.html.

## Features

- Gameplay alternates between two players ('X' and 'O'). The game uses hover/focus styles, as well as a verbal message, to indicate whose turn it currently is.
- When a player clicks/taps a square on the screen, their mark ('X' or 'O') is placed in the square.
- The first player to get 3 of their mark in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all squares on the board are filled without either player getting 3 in a row, the game ends in a tie.
- The game can be restarted at any point by clicking the 'Restart Game' button.
- The game is mobile-friendly and keyboard-navigable.

## Future Features

- an option to set one player to be a computer player
- an option to track how many games each person has won.
